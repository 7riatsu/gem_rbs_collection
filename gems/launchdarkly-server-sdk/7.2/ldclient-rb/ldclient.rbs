    #
    # Creates a new client instance that connects to LaunchDarkly. A custom
    # configuration parameter can also supplied to specify advanced options,
    # but for most use cases, the default configuration is appropriate.
    #
    # The client will immediately attempt to connect to LaunchDarkly and retrieve
    # your feature flag data. If it cannot successfully do so within the time limit
    # specified by `wait_for_sec`, the constructor will return a client that is in
    # an uninitialized state. See {#initialized?} for more details.
    #
    # @param sdk_key [String] the SDK key for your LaunchDarkly account
    # @param config [Config] an optional client configuration object

    # Tells the client that all pending analytics events should be delivered as soon as possible.
    #
    # When the LaunchDarkly client generates analytics events (from {#variation}, {#variation_detail},
    # {#identify}, or {#track}), they are queued on a worker thread. The event thread normally
    # sends all queued events to LaunchDarkly at regular intervals, controlled by the
    # {Config#flush_interval} option. Calling `flush` triggers a send without waiting for the
    # next interval.
    #
    # Flushing is asynchronous, so this method will return before it is complete. However, if you
    # call {#close}, events are guaranteed to be sent before that method returns.

    # Returns whether the client has been initialized and is ready to serve feature flag requests.
    #
    # If this returns false, it means that the client did not succeed in connecting to
    # LaunchDarkly within the time limit that you specified in the constructor. It could
    # still succeed in connecting at a later time (on another thread), or it could have
    # given up permanently (for instance, if your SDK key is invalid). In the meantime,
    # any call to {#variation} or {#variation_detail} will behave as follows:
    #
    # 1. It will check whether the feature store already contains data (that is, you
    # are using a database-backed store and it was populated by a previous run of this
    # application). If so, it will use the last known feature flag data.
    #
    # 2. Failing that, it will return the value that you specified for the `default`
    # parameter of {#variation} or {#variation_detail}.

    #
    # @param key [String] the unique feature key for the feature flag, as shown
    #   on the LaunchDarkly dashboard
    # @param context [Hash, LDContext] a hash or LDContext instance describing the context requesting the flag
    # @param default the default value of the flag; this is used if there is an error
    #   condition making it impossible to find or evaluate the flag

    # Determines the variation of a feature flag for a context, like {#variation}, but also
    # provides additional information about how this value was calculated.
    #
    # The return value of `variation_detail` is an {EvaluationDetail} object, which has
    # three properties: the result value, the positional index of this value in the flag's
    # list of variations, and an object describing the main reason why this value was
    # selected. See {EvaluationDetail} for more on these properties.
    #
    # Calling `variation_detail` instead of `variation` also causes the "reason" data to
    # be included in analytics events, if you are capturing detailed event data for this flag.
    #
    # For more information, see the reference guide on
    # [Evaluation reasons](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).

    # properties, so that LaunchDarkly will know about that context if it does not already.
    #
    # Calling {#variation} or {#variation_detail} also sends the context information to
    # LaunchDarkly (if events are enabled), so you only need to use {#identify} if you
    # want to identify the context without evaluating a flag.
    #
    # Note that event delivery is asynchronous, so the event may not actually be sent
    # until later; see {#flush}.

    #   for Data Export.

    #   normally only used for event generation - such as flag versions and evaluation reasons - should be
    #   omitted for any flag that does not have event tracking or debugging turned on. This reduces the size
    #   of the JSON data if you are passing the flag state to the front end.
