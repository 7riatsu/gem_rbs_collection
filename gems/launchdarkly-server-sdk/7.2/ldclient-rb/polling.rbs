    # The original implementation of this class relied on the feature store
    # directly, which we are trying to move away from. Customers who might have
    # instantiated this directly for some reason wouldn't know they have to set
    # the config's sink manually, so we have to fall back to the store if the
    # sink isn't present.
    #
    # The next major release should be able to simplify this structure and
    # remove the need for fall back to the data store because the update sink
    # should always be present.
